# libft

This is the first project of the 101/42 curriculum. 

We have to recode the main functions of the C library.

It gave me a better understanding of the C language.

I added two functions from different project :

	- int get_next_line(int fd, char **line) reads a file descriptor and record line by line in the char **line.
	- int ft_printf(const char *s, ...) reproduces the printf function.
